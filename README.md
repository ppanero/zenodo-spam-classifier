Zenodo Spam Classifier

## Dataset

The dataset is not included due to its size. However, it is published on Zenodo under the name *zenodo_open_metadata_2020-10-19*. It can be downloaded from [10.5281/zenodo.4114093](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4114093).

Note that is it a big dataset, around 3.5GB, therefore you might want to increase the memory given to jupyter.

# Notebooks

The notebooks are numbered using that one of the section of documentation to which they belong to, and are also in order of usage.

# How to run them

Install the dependencies available in the `requirements.txt` file. Note that they might conflict with existing ones and therefore is recommended to use a virtual environment. In addition, `jupyter` is not included in those dependencies.

# Models, vectors, datasets and other intermediate values

All the produced dataset and models, and some vectors are avaialble and can be downloaded form [10.5281/zenodo.4283435](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4283435).
